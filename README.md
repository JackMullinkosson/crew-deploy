An application designed to automate the crewing up process on film sets by storing user's “Go-To” personnel for specific roles, and allowing them to send batch job offers. When an offer is declined, the app automatically sends the offer to the next person on the “Go-To” list. This can save freelance gig workers a lot of time by eliminating the need to contact people individually in order to fill out their crew list.
